# Emacs config

This repo contains my Emacs configuration. 

## Supported Emacs versions

Make sure to use Emacs 25.1 or greater before installing the packages else there might be some dependencies errors.

## Installation

To install, clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`, i.e., make sure that the `init.el` file is at `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/hedbergr/emacs.d.git
```

When starting Emacs for the first time, thirt-party packages will be automatically downloaded and installed.

## TODO

This config still needs a lot of configuration for different programming language:
- [ ] C
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Erlang
- [ ] Haskell
